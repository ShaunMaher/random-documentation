# random-documentation
Just a place to document things as I learn them.  If you find something useful, great!

## Products that might be useful, I just need to find time to evaluate
* [RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/): FOSS TeamViewer replacement
* [squiggle.com.au](https://api.squiggle.com.au/): The Squiggle API offers public access to basic data about AFL games
* [Turn a tar.gz with binaries into a .deb](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/build-binary-deb-package-practical-guide): For Nerdctl?

## Useful things that I use from time to time
[Systemd Watchdog for any service](https://www.medo64.com/2019/01/systemd-watchdog-for-any-service/)
